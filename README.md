# Personal-Assistant
## Introduction

In this project I will try to develop personal assistant using Python !
All commands have to be said very clearly. It also has to be in English.
Assistant can search term in wikipedia for you and read it, can answer what's the time question.

For weather and search data I'm using two APIs.
 - [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) for weather
 - [SerpAPI](https://serpapi.com/) for google data
### Packages

```shell
pip install wikipedia
```

```shell
pip install SpeechRecognition
```

```shell
pip install pyaudio
```

```shell
pip install google-search-results
```
